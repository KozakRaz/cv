        <h3>A little bit about myself</h3>
        <p>My name is Andrey Mineyev, I am from <em><strong>Ukraine</strong></em>. My life is somewhat interesting, but mostly not, 
            because most of my life time I spent in one room of my house. I have trevelled a lot in the past, and have been to many countries,
            so it is fair to say that I have seen the world. My professional orientation is Marketing, i have graduated 
            from Seneca College at "Business Marketing" faculty. Now I work at an Australian company that provides
            its clients with SEO services for their websites, and I am one of the SEO managers there. I also started
            learning the Web Development tools in order to get into this field in the near future. I think i have a good chance to
            become at least an average web developer.</p>
